# Need of Software: 

In response to the increasing number of projects and Industrial IoT device requirements since mid-2022, Limelight IT team recognized the need for time-saving software solutions. The primary goal was to simplyify the process of creating charts, pivot tables, and other statistical information for efficient data analysis.There was need of feature which can provide instant access to direct statistics, charts, and reports by simply uploading the raw data file generated by the IoT device. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy of installations and field testing, a key feature was needed which can provide real-time graphs with a refresh rate in seconds, and should be easily accessible for any Limelight IT IoT device through a user-friendly interface.  By incorporating capabilities to capture various real-time graph trends and statistics. So that team can focus more on generating insights and finding solutions promptly.

# Software Description: 

The software is built using the Python programming language, utilizing Tkinter for GUI development. It incorporates key libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and calculations. The software leverages Matplotlib, integrated with Tkinter, for data visualization. Additionally, it utilizes Openpyxl and Pdfkit for generating reports in PDF and Excel formats respectively. To facilitate real-time data reception and communication with IoT devices, the software implements the Paho-MQTT library.
